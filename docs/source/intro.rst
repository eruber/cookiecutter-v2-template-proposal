Introduction
************

This document describes a new Cookiecutter version 2 template format based on
two sources:

1. A proof-of-concept submitted via `Cookiecutter Pull Request #848`_
   by `hackebrot`_. Specific format information from this pull request is
   contained herein as notes by `hackebrot`_.

2. Additional format features and functionality described herein are based on
   implementation and usage experience associated with
   `a specific reference implementation of Cookiecutter`_ by `eruber`_ that
   supports this proposed template format.

This document is not meant to serve as a formal template format specification;
it exists simply to describe the template format proposed and its
evolution based on solving practical issues encountered when using the format
to implement a large complex project template.

All errors (via omission or commission), oversights, and/or misguided
implementation decisions reflected herein, rest solely on the shoulders of the
primary author, `eruber`_.
